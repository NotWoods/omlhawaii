Our founder, Garrette Oakes, has brought together a diverse group of highly skilled individuals to
form Oakes Management, LLC. This unique team works to maintain the traditions of old world
craftsmanship, standards, and values. We practice courtesy, respect, and care. We are
thorough and detailed, pragmatic and problem-solving, and experienced. Experience makes one
skeptical, forward thinking, and analytical. We apply this state of mind to the challenge of
monitoring the job - the liaison, subcontractors, costs, schedule, workmanship, and integrity.
From these core ideals, Oakes Management has shaped its sole purpose; to provide construction
services with a strong commitment to honoring the clients and consultants and providing the best
work possible. We believe only by meeting these ideals does one become successful.
